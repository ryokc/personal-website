            <p class = "desc"> This embedded systems project is based off of the popular rhythm games osu! mania, Dance Dance Revolution, or Guitar Hero. The device is built on a self designed pcb and houses a TM4C microcontroller alongside a DAC used for audio output, ADC, and four buttons. There are also two LEDs, an IR LED, and an IR receiver on the board that are not used for this project. The game was coded in C++ while most of the hardware interfacing was coded in C. </p>
